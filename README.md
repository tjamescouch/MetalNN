# MetalNN: Dynamic, GPU-Accelerated Neural Network Framework in Metal üöÄ

This project implements a dynamic, configurable Neural Network framework. Currently supports simple dense layers for regression and classification accelerated by GPU computing via Apple's Metal Shading Language. RNN and other layer types are under construction. It's built to flexibly support complex neural architectures and streamline iterative development.

## Current Features ‚úÖ

- **Dynamic Network Configuration:** 
  - YAML-based model configuration allowing rapid iteration and easy adjustment of neural architectures.
  
- **Supported Layers:**
  - RNN layers (`tanh` activation).
  - Fully connected Dense layers (`linear`, `relu`, `softmax` activations).
  - Dropout layers for regularization.

- **Interactive Training & Inference:**
  - Press `L` to run training (learning) iterations.
  - Press `F` to run forward-pass inference.

- **Logging & Visualization:**
  - Generates a MATLAB-compatible file (`multilayer_nn_training.m`) for easy result visualization in Octave/MATLAB.

## Quickstart üõ†Ô∏è

- Clone the repository.
- Adjust the network architecture in `model-config.yaml`.
- Run the project in Xcode and control training/inference via keyboard commands:
  - **Training:** Press `L`
  - **Forward Pass:** Press `F`

Visualization of results is possible by executing the output MATLAB script in Octave or MATLAB.
